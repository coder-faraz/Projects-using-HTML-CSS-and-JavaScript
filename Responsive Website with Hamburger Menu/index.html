            <p class="secSubTag textSm">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.
                UNESCO defines three main learning settings. Formal education takes place in education and training
                institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided
                by a teacher. </p>

            <p class="secSubTag textSm">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system,
                which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various
                articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act,
                2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The
                approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. For example, a museum
                is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a
                diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich
                interaction, and no externally imposed assessments. </p>

            <p class="secTag textBig"> Informal Learning </p>
            <p class="secSubTag textSm"> Informal learning is one of three forms of learning defined by the Organisation
                for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such
                as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. For
                many learners, this includes language acquisition, cultural norms, and manners.
                A volunteer reads aloud to children in Laos.
                In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner. If
                learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand
                their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned. </p>
